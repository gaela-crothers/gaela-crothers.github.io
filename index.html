    <h1>Welcome to Gaela's EDA Blog</h1>
    <p>
      This website will document my learning progress through Enspiral Dev Academy's Web Development course.
      It is a work in progress and will be constantly changing.

    <h2> A bit about me</h2>
    <p>
      I have been working as a Software Test Analyst within a large organisation for the last 5 years.
      A lot of that has been with an emphasis on testing of web applications, govt web standards, web forms, usability/accessibiliy, UX etc.
      Back in my university days my best mark was actually in INET101 (Basic introduction to web technologies).
      I also have a small business idea that requires a website.
      I thought hey i've always been interested web development, why not learn to code it myself... And so here i am!! :D
